## Problem Statement

The pizza company lacks a centralised system to monitor and analyze its sales data, making it difficult to identify top-performing products, seasonal trends, and underperforming items. Without actionable insights, decision-makers struggle with menu optimization, promotional planning, and inventory management. This dashboard aims to transform raw order data into a visually engaging and interactive report, enabling stakeholders to quickly assess revenue drivers, customer preferences, and operational bottlenecks.

## Steps Followed to Build the Dashboard

o	Built relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys
o	Ensured one-to-many joins (e.g., order_id between orders and order_details)
3.	Measure Creation (DAX)
o	Created key measures: total revenue, quantity sold, average monthly revenue, etc.
o	Used CALCULATE, SUMX, TOPN, and VAR functions to create dynamic insights
4.	Visual Design
