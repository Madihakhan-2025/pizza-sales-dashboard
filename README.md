The Pizza Sales Dashboard’s core purpose is to turn raw transaction data into a clear, interactive view of performance, spotlighting best- and worst-selling pizzas, revenue trends over time, and category breakdowns. Its goal is to equip stakeholders with actionable insights—so they can optimize the menu, tailor promotions, manage inventory, and drive strategic growth—by making complex sales patterns instantly understandable through dynamic visuals and intuitive filters.
